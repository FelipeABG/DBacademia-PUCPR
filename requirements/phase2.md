## Objective:

**Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
- Insert at least 6 records into each table of the database.
- Create 5 update statements for records in different tables.
- Create 5 delete statements for records in different tables.

**Data Query Language (DQL):**
- Specify (textually describe) the 20 queries to be performed on the database (As presented in Project-Based Learning Delivery 1; if there are changes, specify what they are).
- Implement all SELECT statements for each of the information extractions defined in the project.

**Views:**
- Create 3 views in the database.

**Stored Routines (Procedures, Functions, and Triggers):**
- Describe and implement 3 procedures for performing complex operations on the database (one procedure should use cursors).
- Describe and implement 3 functions necessary to return specific values from the database.
- Describe and implement at least 3 triggers to facilitate changes due to insertion, update, and deletion events in the database. There should be at least 1 INSERT trigger, 1 UPDATE trigger, and 1 DELETE trigger.

**Required Modifications:**
- Specify the necessary modifications to the database (if any) to enable information extraction.
- All objectives must adhere to the standards adopted in the course for these representations.

## Requirements:

For the initially defined 20 queries:
- At least 5 queries containing GROUP BY and aggregation functions.
- At least 3 queries containing ORDER BY.
- At least 5 queries using JOIN (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, etc.).

For stored routines:
- Procedures must have more than one statement and should receive parameters.
- Functions must have at least one parameter.
- Triggers must be created in at least two different tables.
