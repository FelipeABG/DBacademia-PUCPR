## Objective:

The objective of this project is to:

- Present the theme of the project that will be developed during the course.
- Detail all data requirements for the application, as well as the functional requirements of the database.
- Represent the problem through Conceptual Modeling.
- Perform the Mapping from Conceptual Model to Logical Model.
- Create the Physical model (SQL script) for the database creation.

All objectives must adhere to the standards adopted in the course for these representations.

## Scenario:

The modeled and implemented database should store, maintain, and retrieve information for the scenario proposed by the student. From the selected scenario, each student must contextualize the "scenario" to facilitate the understanding of the necessary data, relationships, and information to be extracted. Review the example structure proposed in the material from WEEK 02 (Example of University and Restaurant).

## Requirements:

The proposed model must include at least:

- 30 attributes
- Eight entities
- At least 3 (three) N X N relationships (many-to-many relationships).

The proposed Logical Model must include at least 11 tables in the database.

Regarding the information to be extracted, at least 20 should be planned (data <> information).
